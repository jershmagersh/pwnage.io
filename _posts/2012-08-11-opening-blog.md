So this is my blog that I'm going to be working out of over the next number of months until I get some decent hosting.  Basically this blog is for all of my information security research and antics. I'll run through the projects I'm conducting, and give demonstrations of my achievements along the way. Hopefully it is educational and supplies some insight into the world of infosec from my perspective.  So what's up with the name? Basically I am most productive in early mornings, and this is the time where I do most of my reading when it comes to information security topics. Thus, during this timeframe I usually have my daily breakfast routine of eggs, toast, coffee/tea and of course INFOSEC.  Anyways, hopefully you readers get something out of this blog, I will enjoy updating it accordingly.  ~Josh
